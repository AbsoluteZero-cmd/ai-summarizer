1) Aidana Ualikhan, 20241027
2) I was working alone
3) No help was received or offered
4) I spent ~1.5 days doing this assignment
5) Unlike other assignments, this one was not as interesting, and was more focused on mundane error finding (i mean the text of the error from the .sampleish) and comment writing. I liked working with the pipes but besides that the work was surprisingly uninteresting and did not require any creative thinking but simply utilizing the provided libraries' functions
6) No bugs hopefully
